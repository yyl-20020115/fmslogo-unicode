Why doesn't FMSLogo draw on my screen correctly?

   It's a bug in your Video Driver. To workaround it try this:
   On Win95 Right Click on My Computer->Choose Properties->Choose Performance->Choose Graphics
   On Win2K Right Click on Screen->Choose Properties->Choose Adavanced->Choose Trouble Shooting
   Now Back off acceleration one notch, reboot and test FMSLogo and repeat until it works.
   For an actual fix locate and download the most current video drivers and cross your fingers.

Why does SETPENCOLOR [100 100 200] work and SETPENCOLOR [:red :green :blue] does not?

   Because creating a list using braces []'s does not resolve the variables to their
   value. You must dynamically build the list and resolve them. try this:
   SETPENCOLOR (list :red :green :blue)

Why doesn't FMSLogo save my work?

   FMSLogo does not save your "work" it saves only procedures and definitions YOU
   define using the EDITOR or TO/END commands. For simple demonstration see the end
   of the tutorial by going to the Help Menu->Choose Tutorial.
