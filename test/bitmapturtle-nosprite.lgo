  ; This is a regression test for bug #364 and #437
  ;
  ; The functional aspect of the bug #364 was that setting a
  ; turtle to be a rotating bitmap without setting a bitmap caused
  ; FMSLogo to go into an infinite loop.  Because other tests
  ; may create a bitmap, this can only be run through a SHELL
  ; callout to a fresh FMSLogo instance.
