<para>
MCI lets you write &GENERICNAME; procedures to manipulate multimedia devices.
With it, you can link sounds to the steps of drawing a picture.
You can narrate your own slide show.
You can even ask your user questions in your own voice.
The MCI interface is very powerful.
It opens the door to letting &GENERICNAME; control any multimedia device, including sound cards, CD players, movies, and more.
</para>

<para>
Depending on the command, MCI may (or may not) output a status that indicates if the command was successful.
</para>

<para>
The <parameter>mci-command-list</parameter> input must be a list.

</para>

<para>
The MCI allows you to start a device and optionally "wait" for it to finish or to have it "notify" you when it has finished by running the <parameter>callback</parameter> input.
The <parameter>callback</parameter> input is an instruction list that is run when the MCI command completes if you use the "notify" option.
The "notify" mechanism allows you, for example, to play a wave file and be notified when it has completed so that you can start another immediately without sitting and "waiting" for it.
