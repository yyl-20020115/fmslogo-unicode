<para>
If there is a variable named <link linkend="command-printdepthlimit">PRINTDEPTHLIMIT</link> with a nonnegative integer value, then complex list and array structures are printed only to the allowed depth.
That is, members of members of ... of members are allowed only so far.
An elispsis indicates when items are omitted because they exceed the depth limit.
For example, a list with two items that is just before the depth limit is printed as <userinput>[...  ...]</userinput>.
</para>

<para>
If there is a variable named <link linkend="command-printwidthlimit">PRINTWIDTHLIMIT</link> with a nonnegative integer value, then only the first so many items of any array or list are printed.
A single ellipsis replaces all missing objects within the structure.
The width limit also applies to the number of characters printed in a word, except that a PRINTWIDTHLIMIT between 0 and 9 is treated as if it were 10 when applied to words.
This limit applies not only to the top-level printed object but to any substructures within it.
