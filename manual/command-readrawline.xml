<para>
Reads a line from the read stream and outputs that line as a word.
READRAWLINE outputs the exact string of characters as they appear in the line, with no special meaning for backslash, vertical bar, tilde, or any other formatting characters.
The output is a single word even if the line contains spaces, brackets, etc.
</para>
<para>
If the read stream is a file and the last character in the file is not an end-of-line sequence, then READRAWLINE treats the end-of-file as an end-of-line.
After the file as been completely read, READRAWLINE outputs the empty list (not the empty word).
