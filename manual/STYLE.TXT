This is a brief overview of the style of the FMSLogo manual.

Most of the style violations are checked by check-manual.pl, which is runnable
with "make test".  This should be run before any change to the manual is
committed.

This document describes the style guidelines that are not checked
programmatically.

1) The manual uses the serial comma (also called a Oxford comma).
   This is the third comma in the sentence:
   A SQUARE consists of moving forward, turning left, and repeating four times.

2) The voice is primarily formal and authoritative (to give confidence)
   Where techinical accuracy is not compromised, it is also friendly and
   encouraging, as if talking to a friend.
   It is never condescending or insulting.
   The use of "you" is preferred to "the programmer" or "the user".
   The use of "you" is also an acceptable way to use the active voice.

3) The documentation is generally in the present tense, not future tense.
   For example "COMMAND does X", not "COMMAND will do X".

4) Punctuation falls outside the quotation to clarify what's really intended
   to be quoted.  For example: SHOW 123 prints "123".

5) When giving examples, the explanation should be given outside the code
   sample, as an introductory sentence (as opposed to inside the code
   sample as a comment).
   This is violated in many places and all of them should be fixed.
   Ideally this would be enforced by check-manual.pl.

6) Unless the specific context prevents it, procedure names are given in
   all caps.  Variable names and property list names are given lowercase.
