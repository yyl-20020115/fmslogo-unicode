<para>
Flushes all buffered output to the open port.
</para>

<para>
Because writing to a port can be slow, the operating system stores data which you write in a temporary holding place called a "buffer" and writes it to the port at the appropriate speed.
This buffering makes your program faster, as your program does not need to wait for the data to be sent to the port before continuing its execution.
The act of flushing actively pushes all data which is in the buffer to the port.
After the flush is complete, you can be sure that all of the data which you have previously written to the port has really been sent there.
</para>

<para>
The <parameter>input</parameter> input is required, but is otherwise ignored.
It is retained as a required input for backward compatibility with older programs.
