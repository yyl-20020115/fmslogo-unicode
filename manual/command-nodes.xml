<listitem>
<para>
Outputs a list of two numbers.
The first is the number of nodes of memory currently in use.
The second is the maximum number of nodes that have been in use at any time since the last invocation of NODES.
</para>

<para>
A node is a small block of computer memory used by &GENERICNAME;.
Each number uses one node.
Each non-numeric word uses one node, plus some non-node memory for the characters in the word.
Each array takes one node, plus some non-node memory, as well as the memory required by its members.
Each list requires one node per member, as well as the memory within the members.
</para>

<para>
NODES is useful it you want to ensure that your program isn't inadvertantly keeping references on a large number of NODEs that would cause &PRODUCTNAME;'s memory usage to grow and grow.
