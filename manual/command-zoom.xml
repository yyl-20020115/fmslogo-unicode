<para>
Sets the scale of the "Screen" window.
The <parameter>scale</parameter> input is the amount to zoom (scale) by.
A number greater than 1.0 makes things bigger (for example, 2.0 makes it twice as big), a number smaller than 1.0 makes things smaller (0.5 makes it half as big).
If an existing image is on the screen when you zoom, then it is stretched or squeezed according to the zoom.
The resulting image may look a little jagged, but if you "draw" while zoomed, the new lines are not as jagged.
</para>

<para>
Even though things may appear jagged &PRODUCTNAME; remembers everything as if zoom was normal (1.0) and only prints at the normal scale.
Once you zoom back to a scale of 1.0, your image will not be stretched or squeezed to fit again.
In other words, in a zoom of 1.0 lines are never jagged even if you drew them at zoom 0.5 or 2.0.
</para>

<para>
ZOOM works best when <parameter>scale</parameter> is a power of two, such as 2, 4, 8, 1/2 (0.5), 1/4 (0.25), 1/8 (0.125), etc.
